  &nbsp;#TidyTuesday Contributions&nbsp;
</h1>

My contributions to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem, with an emphasis on understanding how to summarise and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}`, `{dplyr}` and other tools in the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem. The project was founded in 2018 by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and organized by the [R4DS ("`R` for Data Science") online learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity). The intent is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualisation skills independent of drawing conclusions.
